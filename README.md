This project focuses on healthcare data analysis using socio-economic and demographic datasets to derive actionable insights for healthcare improvement and policy-making. The project aims to identify patterns and trends that can help stakeholders make informed decisions in the healthcare sector.

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handling missing data, outliers, and normalizing variables.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding the data's distribution, correlation analysis, and initial visualizations to uncover hidden trends.
Visualization: Insights were visualized using Power BI, Tableau, and Matplotlib, providing easy-to-understand dashboards for end-users.
Healthcare Recommendations: Based on the analysis, we provided recommendations for healthcare interventions, policies, and resource allocation.
Reports: Detailed documentation of the analysis process, key findings, and insights
